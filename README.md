## Overview

A Python package for high-fidelity serialization and deserialization of exceptions and their complete tracebacks. Unlike other
solutions, `offline-debug` reconstructs **actual** `types.FrameType` objects using the Python C API, ensuring that re-raised
exceptions look and feel genuine to debuggers and introspection tools.

## Core Functions

- `save_traceback(exc: BaseException, file: Path | BytesIO)`:
  Serializes an exception, its traceback, and all picklable local/global variables to a binary file or buffer.
- `load_traceback(file: Path | BytesIO) -> Never`:
  Loads the serialized state, reconstructs the exception and its full traceback chain (including `__cause__` and `__context__`),
  and raises it.

## Usage Example

to get started, install with:  
`pip install offline-debug` or `uv add offline-debug`

```python
from pathlib import Path
from offline_debug import save_traceback, load_traceback

try:
    # Code that might fail
    some_complex_operation()
except Exception as e:
    save_traceback(e, Path("crash_report.dump"))

# To debug or re-examine later:
load_traceback(Path("crash_report.dump"))
```

## Technical Implementation

- **True Frame Reconstruction**: Uses `ctypes` to call `PyFrame_New` from the Python C API. This creates real `frame` objects
  which are required for a valid `types.TracebackType`.
- **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Leverages PEP 667 features where `f_locals` is a write-through proxy, allowing for accurate local
  variable restoration.
- **Support python 3.12 as well**
- **Robust Serialization**:
    - `pickle` is used for exceptions and variables.
    - `marshal` is used for code objects.
    - Non-picklable items are gracefully handled by storing their `repr`.

## Development & Tooling

- **Package Manager**: `uv`
- **Minimum Python**: 3.12
- **Testing**: `pytest`
- **Commands**:
    - Add dependencies: `uv add <package>`
    - Run tests: `uv run pytest`
